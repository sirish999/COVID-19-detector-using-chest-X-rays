COVID-19 detector using chest X-rays | Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Deep Learning, Pandas

• A Capsule network was trained to detect COVID-19 from images of patient’s lung X-rays to overcome shortcomings of CNN.
• Neural Network was pre-trained on big data (96k lung x-rays) before deploying on main dataset for training.
• Extensive Data pre-processing and fine tuning of hyper-parameters outperformed previous approaches by 8% in accuracy.
